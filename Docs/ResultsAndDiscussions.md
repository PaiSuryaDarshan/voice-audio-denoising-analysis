# Results and discussions

## 0. Human Opinion

<h3>What do I think of the results, the first time I heard it ?</h3>

```
(
    1. compare standard and manual to input.
    2. compare them to each other:
        - Distinguish difference in Clarity
        - Loudness
        - Weird voice modulation (the pitch wobble).
    )
```

So with that information. Now that we know what to keep an eye out for,
Let's "SEE" what that sounded like...

## 1.First Active Sample

![as](../Images/first_active_sample.png)

### Interpretation

(Explain AGC and orthogonal systems that introduce dead zone.)

## 2.Peak to Peak (FAS)

![as](../Images/p2p.png)

### Interpretation

## 3.Root Mean Square (FAS)

![as](../Images/RMS_50ms.png)

### Interpretation

## 4.Signal Noise Ratio (SNR)

(A) Waveform overlay
![as](../Images/snr_wf.png)

(B) SNR comparison
![as](../Images/snr_lvl.png)

### Interpretation

(Explain low signal to noise ratio with for Standard on Plot B, reason it with the low scales (shown on Plot A, look at y-axis scale) for standard at which this comparison is being done. and why from the overlay subplot (the topmost one in plot A) actully shows why this offers the best clarity.) Explain how this low scale however, is also why it sounds so quiet.

## 5.Relative Loudness

![as](../Images/relative_loudness_levels.png)

### Interpretation

(Explain how the standard was clear but low in volume)

## 6.Pitch Step Size Distribution: Explaining the pitch wobble

![as](../Images/distribution_of_pitch_step_sizes.png)

### Interpretation

(Explain how the infamous pitch wobble.)

## Note to reader who got this far,

There is more analysis not covered in this document that can be found in the comparative signal analysis notebook linked [HERE](../notebooks/comparitive_signal_analysis.ipynb).
